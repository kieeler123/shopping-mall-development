# Day 16 --- STEP 16. Translating useOrders CRUD into HTTP

> **Goal of This Step:** Keep the existing CRUD intent while replacing
> localStorage data access with an HTTP API.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 0. Where This Step Fits

Day 16 is not a list of unrelated vocabulary. Each Step zooms into one
part of the same architecture.

``` text
User
↓
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
API / Server
↓
Database
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React State
↓
UI
```

The most useful first question for every new term is: **Where does this
concept live in this flow, and what problem does it solve?**

> **Tip**
>
> Before memorizing a definition, classify the concept: Client-side,
> Server-side, Request, Response, data representation, or a larger
> communication rule.

## 1. The existing useOrders structure

A Server result does not automatically become visible UI. React renders
from its own State, so the Client must process the Response and
synchronize State.

``` text
HTTP Response
↓
check result / process Body
↓
React State
↓
rerender
↓
UI
```

Server-side persistent data and React State are not the same storage.
The Server may be the source of truth for persistent order data, while
React State is the Client-side representation currently driving the
interface.

This is also why server-backed UI often needs more than `orders`: it
needs to distinguish Data, Loading, and Error.

> **Tip**

> At the end of every API example, ask: "Which State changes, and what
> should the user see after that State change?"

## 2. Why the Hook can remain useful

A Server result does not automatically become visible UI. React renders
from its own State, so the Client must process the Response and
synchronize State.

``` text
HTTP Response
↓
check result / process Body
↓
React State
↓
rerender
↓
UI
```

Server-side persistent data and React State are not the same storage.
The Server may be the source of truth for persistent order data, while
React State is the Client-side representation currently driving the
interface.

This is also why server-backed UI often needs more than `orders`: it
needs to distinguish Data, Loading, and Error.

>
> At the end of every API example, ask: "Which State changes, and what
> should the user see after that State change?"

## 3. getOrders becomes GET /orders

In a CRUD-style Orders API, GET commonly expresses a Read operation.

``` http
GET /orders
```

can represent reading the order collection, while:

``` http
GET /orders/10
```

can represent reading one order. GET should not be equated directly with
a database `SELECT`: the Server may authenticate the caller, check
permissions, process query options, apply business logic, query several
data sources, and shape the final response.

Under HTTP semantics GET is safe and idempotent. "Safe" does not mean
cybersecurity-safe, and "idempotent" does not require an identical
Response every time.

> **Tip**
>
> When you see GET, ask both "What is being read?" and "Does this
> request semantics ask the Server to change Resource state?"

## 4. getOrder becomes GET /orders/:id

In a CRUD-style Orders API, GET commonly expresses a Read operation.

``` http
GET /orders
```

can represent reading the order collection, while:

``` http
GET /orders/10
```

can represent reading one order. GET should not be equated directly with
a database `SELECT`: the Server may authenticate the caller, check
permissions, process query options, apply business logic, query several
data sources, and shape the final response.

Under HTTP semantics GET is safe and idempotent. "Safe" does not mean
cybersecurity-safe, and "idempotent" does not require an identical
Response every time.

> **Tip**
>
> When you see GET, ask both "What is being read?" and "Does this
> request semantics ask the Server to change Resource state?"

## 5. addOrder becomes POST /orders

In a CRUD-style Orders API, creation is commonly expressed with
`POST /orders`.

``` http
POST /orders
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "productId": 3,
  "quantity": 2
}
```

The Client's `newOrder` is input, not necessarily the authoritative
final Resource. The Server can validate the product and quantity,
calculate authoritative values, create an ID, choose an initial status,
write to the Database, and return a `createdOrder`.

``` text
newOrder
↓ POST
Server
↓
createdOrder
```

`201 Created` is a common success status for resource creation, but it
is not the only possible successful contract. POST is not safe and is
generally not idempotent; retrying a creation request can create
duplicates unless the API has additional safeguards.

> **Tip**
>
> Separate "what the Client asked to create" from "what the Server
> confirms was created."

## 6. updateOrder becomes PATCH /orders/:id

PATCH is commonly used for partial modification. Read the URL and Body
as two different questions.

``` http
PATCH /orders/10
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "shipping"
}
```

``` text
/orders/10 → Which Resource?
Body       → What should change?
```

Partial does not mean "exactly one field." The Server may also reject a
syntactically valid update because a business rule forbids the requested
state transition.

PATCH itself does not guarantee idempotency. "Set status to shipping"
may have an idempotent effect, while "increment quantity by one" may
not.

> **Tip**
>
> Remember PATCH as **Target + Changes**, not as "one-field update."

## 7. deleteOrder becomes DELETE /orders/:id

DELETE expresses a request to remove a Resource.

``` http
DELETE /orders/10
```

For simple deletion, Method + Path often express enough intent that no
Request Body is needed, although an API contract may define otherwise.
Successful deletion might return `204 No Content`, or an API might use
`200 OK` with a Body.

DELETE is not safe because it requests a state change. Under HTTP
semantics it is idempotent: the first request might return 204 and a
repeated request 404, while the intended final state remains "the
Resource is absent."

> **Tip**
>
> Idempotency is about the intended state effect, not identical Status
> Codes or identical Response Bodies.

## 8. Inputs and outputs of each operation

`Inputs and outputs of each operation` should be understood as part of
one end-to-end communication model rather than as an isolated
definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React
```

The same Path can represent different operations when the Method
changes, and the same endpoint can produce different responses depending
on authentication, input, resource existence, or server processing. HTTP
therefore needs to be read as a combination of message direction,
semantics, destination, metadata, content, and result.

The shopping-order project gives us a concrete reference point: instead
of memorizing a term, ask where it appears during order retrieval,
creation, modification, or deletion.

> After reading this section, explain it using one concrete order
> scenario without looking at the definition.

## 9. localStorage source versus Server source

The browser Client and the Server sit on different sides of a trust
boundary. A user can inspect or manipulate Client-side behavior, so
important business rules cannot rely only on React code.

``` text
Request
↓
Server
├─ Authentication
├─ Authorization
├─ Parsing
├─ Validation
├─ Business Logic
└─ Database access
↓
Response
```

The Server and Database are also different roles. The Database stores
and retrieves data; the Server interprets requests, applies rules,
coordinates data access, and constructs responses. Not every endpoint
performs every step above, but this model explains why a Server is more
than "remote localStorage."

> **Tip**
>
> Client-side validation is valuable for UX, but it does not replace
> server-side validation or authorization.

## 10. The Server response as the authoritative result

The browser Client and the Server sit on different sides of a trust
boundary. A user can inspect or manipulate Client-side behavior, so
important business rules cannot rely only on React code.

``` text
Request
↓
Server
├─ Authentication
├─ Authorization
├─ Parsing
├─ Validation
├─ Business Logic
└─ Database access
↓
Response
```

The Server and Database are also different roles. The Database stores
and retrieves data; the Server interprets requests, applies rules,
coordinates data access, and constructs responses. Not every endpoint
performs every step above, but this model explains why a Server is more
than "remote localStorage."

> **Tip**
>
> Client-side validation is valuable for UX, but it does not replace
> server-side validation or authorization.

## 11. Synchronizing React State

A Server result does not automatically become visible UI. React renders
from its own State, so the Client must process the Response and
synchronize State.

``` text
HTTP Response
↓
check result / process Body
↓
React State
↓
rerender
↓
UI
```

Server-side persistent data and React State are not the same storage.
The Server may be the source of truth for persistent order data, while
React State is the Client-side representation currently driving the
interface.

This is also why server-backed UI often needs more than `orders`: it
needs to distinguish Data, Loading, and Error.

> **Tip**
>
> At the end of every API example, ask: "Which State changes, and what
> should the user see after that State change?"

## 12. Loading enters the design

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a
Promise**. `fetch()` is a Browser Web API, and `fetch()` returns a
Promise. `await` waits for that Promise-based operation within the
current async function; it does not freeze the entire browser.

An HTTP `404` or `500` normally still arrives as a Response, so
`fetch()` does not reject merely because the HTTP status is
unsuccessful. A network or transport failure can instead reject the
Promise. This is why `response.ok` and `try/catch` solve different parts
of the problem.

> **Tip**
>
> Keep two failure layers separate: "The Server responded with an
> unsuccessful HTTP status" versus "The asynchronous/network operation
> rejected."

## 13. Error enters the design

`Error enters the design` should be understood as part of one end-to-end
communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React
```

The same Path can represent different operations when the Method
changes, and the same endpoint can produce different responses depending
on authentication, input, resource existence, or server processing. HTTP
therefore needs to be read as a combination of message direction,
semantics, destination, metadata, content, and result.

The shopping-order project gives us a concrete reference point: instead
of memorizing a term, ask where it appears during order retrieval,
creation, modification, or deletion.

> scenario without looking at the definition.

## 14. Separating component and Hook responsibilities

A Server result does not automatically become visible UI. React renders
from its own State, so the Client must process the Response and
synchronize State.

``` text
HTTP Response
↓
check result / process Body
↓
React State
↓
rerender
↓
UI
```

Server-side persistent data and React State are not the same storage.
The Server may be the source of truth for persistent order data, while
React State is the Client-side representation currently driving the
interface.

This is also why server-backed UI often needs more than `orders`: it
needs to distinguish Data, Loading, and Error.

## Common Misconceptions to Check

Do not reduce **Translating useOrders CRUD into HTTP** to a single
memorized keyword. In particular, keep these boundaries clear:

``` text
HTTP ≠ API
API ≠ Server
Server ≠ Database
Request ≠ Method
Response ≠ JSON
Body ≠ JSON
Status Code ≠ Response
fetch() ≠ HTTP
```

Not every line is the main topic of this Step, but keeping the complete
boundary map visible prevents one concept from silently replacing
another.

> When two terms feel similar, write one question each term answers. For
> example: `Method → What action is requested?` and
> `Status Code → What was the processing result?`

## Explain It Yourself

Without looking back, answer these questions:

1.  What does **Translating useOrders CRUD into HTTP** mean in the order
    project?
2.  Where does it appear in the Request → Server → Response flow?
3.  How does it appear when reading orders?
4.  How does it appear when creating or changing an order?
5.  What common misconception could cause incorrect `fetch()` code?
6.  After the Response arrives, how does React State/UI become involved?

## STEP 16 Checklist

-   [ ] I can explain: Keep the existing CRUD intent while replacing
    localStorage data access with an HTTP API.
-   [ ] I can demonstrate it with an Orders API example.
-   [ ] I can distinguish it from neighboring HTTP/API concepts.
-   [ ] I can place it inside Request → Server → Response → State → UI.
-   [ ] I can connect it to Day 15 asynchronous JavaScript or Day 17
    `fetch()` where relevant.

## Bridge to the Next Step

Put this concept back into the full HTTP round trip before moving on.
The next Step will zoom into the next component using the same sequence:
**why it exists → exact role → order example → common confusion → React
connection**.
