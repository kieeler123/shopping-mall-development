# Day 16 --- STEP 15. HTTP with Promise, async, await, and try/catch

> **Goal of This Step:** Connect Day 15 asynchronous JavaScript to
> fetch-based HTTP communication, response.ok, and error handling.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 0. Where This Step Fits

Day 16 is not a list of unrelated vocabulary. Each Step zooms into one
part of the same architecture.

The most useful first question for every new term is: **Where does this
concept live in this flow, and what problem does it solve?**

> Server-side, Request, Response, data representation, or a larger
> communication rule.

## 1. Why network work involves waiting

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a
Promise**. `fetch()` is a Browser Web API, and `fetch()` returns a
Promise. `await` waits for that Promise-based operation within the
current async function; it does not freeze the entire browser.

An HTTP `404` or `500` normally still arrives as a Response, so
`fetch()` does not reject merely because the HTTP status is
unsuccessful. A network or transport failure can instead reject the
Promise. This is why `response.ok` and `try/catch` solve different parts
of the problem.

> **Tip**
>
> Keep two failure layers separate: "The Server responded with an
> unsuccessful HTTP status" versus "The asynchronous/network operation
> rejected."

## 6. async functions

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text

pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

## 7. What await waits for

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a

## 8. await does not freeze the entire browser

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a

## 9. The Response object

`The Response object` should be understood as part of one end-to-end
communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React
```

The same Path can represent different operations when the Method
changes, and the same endpoint can produce different responses depending
on authentication, input, resource existence, or server processing. HTTP
therefore needs to be read as a combination of message direction,
semantics, destination, metadata, content, and result.

The shopping-order project gives us a concrete reference point: instead
of memorizing a term, ask where it appears during order retrieval,
creation, modification, or deletion.

> **Tip**
>
> After reading this section, explain it using one concrete order
> scenario without looking at the definition.

## 10. response.json() also returns a Promise

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a
Promise**. `fetch()` is a Browser Web API, and `fetch()` returns a
Promise. `await` waits for that Promise-based operation within the
current async function; it does not freeze the entire browser.

An HTTP `404` or `500` normally still arrives as a Response, so
`fetch()` does not reject merely because the HTTP status is
unsuccessful. A network or transport failure can instead reject the
Promise. This is why `response.ok` and `try/catch` solve different parts
of the problem.

> rejected."

## 11. The role of try/catch

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a
Promise**. `fetch()` is a Browser Web API, and `fetch()` returns a
Promise. `await` waits for that Promise-based operation within the
current async function; it does not freeze the entire browser.

An HTTP `404` or `500` normally still arrives as a Response, so

unsuccessful. A network or transport failure can instead reject the
Promise. This is why `response.ok` and `try/catch` solve different parts
of the problem.

> **Tip**

> rejected."

## 12. 404/500 versus rejection

A Status Code is not the whole Response. It is the HTTP-level result
signal contained inside a Response.

``` text
HTTP Response
├─ Status Code
├─ Headers
└─ Body
```

A `404` Response may still contain a JSON error Body. A `204` is
successful but intentionally has no response Body. This is why
application code must not assume that every successful Response should
be parsed as JSON.

It is also useful to pair the two directions: the **Method** expresses
what the Client is asking for, while the **Status Code** reports how the
Server processed that request.

> **Tip**
>
> Do not memorize status numbers in isolation. Attach each code to a
> concrete order scenario and ask what the React UI should do with that
> result.

## 13. Network failures

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a
Promise**. `fetch()` is a Browser Web API, and `fetch()` returns a
Promise. `await` waits for that Promise-based operation within the
current async function; it does not freeze the entire browser.

An HTTP `404` or `500` normally still arrives as a Response, so
`fetch()` does not reject merely because the HTTP status is
unsuccessful. A network or transport failure can instead reject the
Promise. This is why `response.ok` and `try/catch` solve different parts
of the problem.

## 14. response.ok

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a
Promise**. `fetch()` is a Browser Web API, and `fetch()` returns a
Promise. `await` waits for that Promise-based operation within the
current async function; it does not freeze the entire browser.

of the problem.

## 15. Explicitly throwing on HTTP failure

`Explicitly throwing on HTTP failure` should be understood as part of
one end-to-end communication model rather than as an isolated
definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React
```

The same Path can represent different operations when the Method
changes, and the same endpoint can produce different responses depending
on authentication, input, resource existence, or server processing. HTTP
therefore needs to be read as a combination of message direction,
semantics, destination, metadata, content, and result.

of memorizing a term, ask where it appears during order retrieval,
creation, modification, or deletion.

## Common Misconceptions to Check

Do not reduce **HTTP with Promise, async, await, and try/catch** to a
single memorized keyword. In particular, keep these boundaries clear:

``` text
HTTP ≠ API
API ≠ Server
Server ≠ Database
Request ≠ Method
Response ≠ JSON
Body ≠ JSON
Status Code ≠ Response
fetch() ≠ HTTP
```

Not every line is the main topic of this Step, but keeping the complete
boundary map visible prevents one concept from silently replacing
another.

> example: `Method → What action is requested?` and
> `Status Code → What was the processing result?`

## Explain It Yourself

Without looking back, answer these questions:

1.  What does **HTTP with Promise, async, await, and try/catch** mean in
    the order project?
2.  Where does it appear in the Request → Server → Response flow?
3.  How does it appear when reading orders?
4.  How does it appear when creating or changing an order?
5.  What common misconception could cause incorrect `fetch()` code?
6.  After the Response arrives, how does React State/UI become involved?

> place where your explanation stops is the place that needs review.

## STEP 15 Checklist

-   [ ] I can explain: Connect Day 15 asynchronous JavaScript to
    fetch-based HTTP communication, response.ok, and error handling.
-   [ ] I can demonstrate it with an Orders API example.
-   [ ] I can distinguish it from neighboring HTTP/API concepts.
-   [ ] I can place it inside Request → Server → Response → State → UI.
-   [ ] I can connect it to Day 15 asynchronous JavaScript or Day 17
    `fetch()` where relevant.

## Bridge to the Next Step

Put this concept back into the full HTTP round trip before moving on.
The next Step will zoom into the next component using the same sequence:
**why it exists → exact role → order example → common confusion → React
