# Day 16 --- STEP 05. URL, Path, Endpoint, Path Parameters, and Query Parameters

> **Goal of This Step:** Distinguish the concepts used to identify an
> API destination and express request conditions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 0. Where This Step Fits

Day 16 is not a list of unrelated vocabulary. Each Step zooms into one
part of the same architecture.

The most useful first question for every new term is: **Where does this
concept live in this flow, and what problem does it solve?**

> **Tip**
>
> Before memorizing a definition, classify the concept: Client-side,
> Server-side, Request, Response, data representation, or a larger
> communication rule.

## 1. The full URL

`The full URL` should be understood as part of one end-to-end
communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React
```

The same Path can represent different operations when the Method
changes, and the same endpoint can produce different responses depending
on authentication, input, resource existence, or server processing. HTTP
therefore needs to be read as a combination of message direction,
semantics, destination, metadata, content, and result.

The shopping-order project gives us a concrete reference point: instead
of memorizing a term, ask where it appears during order retrieval,
creation, modification, or deletion.

## 2. Base URL and Path

## Common Misconceptions to Check

Do not reduce **URL, Path, Endpoint, Path Parameters, and Query
Parameters** to a single memorized keyword. In particular, keep these
boundaries clear:

``` text
HTTP ≠ API
API ≠ Server
Server ≠ Database
Request ≠ Method
Response ≠ JSON
Body ≠ JSON
Status Code ≠ Response
fetch() ≠ HTTP
```

Not every line is the main topic of this Step, but keeping the complete
boundary map visible prevents one concept from silently replacing
another.

> **Tip**
>
> When two terms feel similar, write one question each term answers. For
> example: `Method → What action is requested?` and
> `Status Code → What was the processing result?`

## Explain It Yourself

Without looking back, answer these questions:

1.  What does **URL, Path, Endpoint, Path Parameters, and Query
    Parameters** mean in the order project?
2.  Where does it appear in the Request → Server → Response flow?
3.  How does it appear when reading orders?
4.  How does it appear when creating or changing an order?
5.  What common misconception could cause incorrect `fetch()` code?
6.  After the Response arrives, how does React State/UI become involved?

> Try explaining each answer aloud before rereading the section. The
> place where your explanation stops is the place that needs review.

## STEP 05 Checklist

-   [ ] I can explain: Distinguish the concepts used to identify an API
    destination and express request conditions.
-   [ ] I can demonstrate it with an Orders API example.
-   [ ] I can distinguish it from neighboring HTTP/API concepts.
-   [ ] I can place it inside Request → Server → Response → State → UI.
-   [ ] I can connect it to Day 15 asynchronous JavaScript or Day 17
    `fetch()` where relevant.

## STEP 05 Key Sentence

> **Distinguish the concepts used to identify an API destination and
> express request conditions.**

## Bridge to the Next Step

Put this concept back into the full HTTP round trip before moving on.
The next Step will zoom into the next component using the same sequence:
**why it exists → exact role → order example → common confusion → React
connection**.
