# Day 16 --- STEP 13. JSON

> **Goal of This Step:** Distinguish JSON text from JavaScript runtime
> values and understand serialization and parsing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 0. Where This Step Fits

Day 16 is not a list of unrelated vocabulary. Each Step zooms into one
part of the same architecture.

``` text

↓
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
API / Server
↓
Database
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React State
↓
UI
```

The most useful first question for every new term is: **Where does this
concept live in this flow, and what problem does it solve?**

> **Tip**

> Before memorizing a definition, classify the concept: Client-side,
> Server-side, Request, Response, data representation, or a larger
> communication rule.

## 1. JavaScript runtime values

`JavaScript runtime values` should be understood as part of one
end-to-end communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React
```

The same Path can represent different operations when the Method
changes, and the same endpoint can produce different responses depending
on authentication, input, resource existence, or server processing. HTTP
therefore needs to be read as a combination of message direction,
semantics, destination, metadata, content, and result.

The shopping-order project gives us a concrete reference point: instead
of memorizing a term, ask where it appears during order retrieval,
creation, modification, or deletion.

## 2. What JSON actually is

This concept becomes much easier when you separate **a runtime value**,
**its representation**, and **its position inside an HTTP message**.

``` text
JavaScript value
↓ serialization
JSON text
↓
HTTP Body

HTTP Body containing JSON
↓ parsing
JavaScript value
```

Headers are metadata about the message; they are not the message content
itself. JSON is one possible representation that can appear in a Body.
`Content-Type: application/json` describes the media type of the current
message Body.

A common beginner mistake is to call every object-looking value "JSON."
In JavaScript, `{ id: 10 }` can simply be a runtime object. Only after
serialization are we dealing with JSON text for transmission or storage.

> **Tip**
>
> Whenever you see braces in code, ask: "Is this a JavaScript runtime
> value, serialized JSON text, or content inside an HTTP Body?"

## 3. Why JSON resembles JavaScript object syntax

This concept becomes much easier when you separate **a runtime value**,
**its representation**, and **its position inside an HTTP message**.

``` text
JavaScript value
↓ serialization
JSON text
↓
HTTP Body

HTTP Body containing JSON
↓ parsing
JavaScript value
```

## 4. Syntax differences

`Syntax differences` should be understood as part of one end-to-end
communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React
```

changes, and the same endpoint can produce different responses depending
on authentication, input, resource existence, or server processing. HTTP
therefore needs to be read as a combination of message direction,
semantics, destination, metadata, content, and result.

creation, modification, or deletion.

## 5. Double-quoted object keys

`Double-quoted object keys` should be understood as part of one
end-to-end communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server

HTTP Response
↓

creation, modification, or deletion.

## 6. Functions and undefined

`Functions and undefined` should be understood as part of one end-to-end
communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

``` text

Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response

## 7. Trailing commas

`Trailing commas` should be understood as part of one end-to-end
communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

**its representation**, and **its position inside an HTTP message**.

``` text
JavaScript value

**its representation**, and **its position inside an HTTP message**.

``` text
JavaScript value
↓ serialization
JSON text
↓
HTTP Body

HTTP Body containing JSON
↓ parsing
JavaScript value
```

## 13. HTTP Body versus JSON

This concept becomes much easier when you separate **a runtime value**,
**its representation**, and **its position inside an HTTP message**.

``` text
JavaScript value
↓ serialization
JSON text
↓
HTTP Body

HTTP Body containing JSON
↓ parsing
JavaScript value
```

## 14. Objects do not teleport over the network

Network communication takes time, so HTTP work naturally meets
JavaScript's asynchronous programming model.

``` text
fetch()
↓
Promise
↓
pending
↓
HTTP communication
↓
Response-related result or rejection
```

The precise distinction matters: **HTTP itself does not return a
Promise**. `fetch()` is a Browser Web API, and `fetch()` returns a
Promise. `await` waits for that Promise-based operation within the
current async function; it does not freeze the entire browser.

An HTTP `404` or `500` normally still arrives as a Response, so
`fetch()` does not reject merely because the HTTP status is
unsuccessful. A network or transport failure can instead reject the
Promise. This is why `response.ok` and `try/catch` solve different parts
of the problem.

> **Tip**
>
> Keep two failure layers separate: "The Server responded with an
> unsuccessful HTTP status" versus "The asynchronous/network operation
> rejected."

## 15. Connecting to response.json()

`Connecting to response.json()` should be understood as part of one
end-to-end communication model rather than as an isolated definition.

``` text
React Client
↓
HTTP Request
↓
Orders API / Server
↓
HTTP Response
↓
React
```

The same Path can represent different operations when the Method
changes, and the same endpoint can produce different responses depending
on authentication, input, resource existence, or server processing. HTTP
therefore needs to be read as a combination of message direction,
semantics, destination, metadata, content, and result.

The shopping-order project gives us a concrete reference point: instead
of memorizing a term, ask where it appears during order retrieval,
creation, modification, or deletion.

## Put It Back into the Complete Order Flow

``` text

      │ HTTP Request
      │ ├─ Method
      │ ├─ URL / Endpoint
      │ ├─ Headers

      ▼
Orders API / Server
      │
      ├─ Authentication
      ├─ Authorization

      ├─ Data
      ├─ Loading
      └─ Error
      ▼
State → rerender → UI
```

## Common Misconceptions to Check

Do not reduce **JSON** to a single memorized keyword. In particular,
keep these boundaries clear:

``` text
HTTP ≠ API
API ≠ Server
Server ≠ Database
Request ≠ Method
Response ≠ JSON
Body ≠ JSON
Status Code ≠ Response
fetch() ≠ HTTP
```

Not every line is the main topic of this Step, but keeping the complete
boundary map visible prevents one concept from silently replacing
another.

> When two terms feel similar, write one question each term answers. For
> example: `Method → What action is requested?` and
> `Status Code → What was the processing result?`

## Explain It Yourself

Without looking back, answer these questions:

1.  What does **JSON** mean in the order project?
2.  Where does it appear in the Request → Server → Response flow?
3.  How does it appear when reading orders?
4.  How does it appear when creating or changing an order?
5.  What common misconception could cause incorrect `fetch()` code?
6.  After the Response arrives, how does React State/UI become involved?

## STEP 13 Checklist

-   [ ] I can explain: Distinguish JSON text from JavaScript runtime
    values and understand serialization and parsing.
-   [ ] I can demonstrate it with an Orders API example.
-   [ ] I can distinguish it from neighboring HTTP/API concepts.
-   [ ] I can place it inside Request → Server → Response → State → UI.
-   [ ] I can connect it to Day 15 asynchronous JavaScript or Day 17
    `fetch()` where relevant.

## STEP 13 Key Sentence

## Bridge to the Next Step

Put this concept back into the full HTTP round trip before moving on.
The next Step will zoom into the next component using the same sequence:
**why it exists → exact role → order example → common confusion → React
connection**.
